## Description
This is a note-taking application that allows users to view saved notes, write and save new notes, and delete saved notes when needed. Saved notes will be stored in a JS file acting as a database and accessed by http GET, POST, and DELETE methods.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
From the homepage, the user will need to click the 'Get Started' button to be taken to the notes page.

Once there, any saved notes will display as a list on the left-hand side. To view a saved note, the user should click on it's title. To delete a saved note, the user can simply click on the trash can icon to the right of the notes title.

To write a new note after having viewed a saved note, the user just needs to click on the plus sign in the top right corner of the page.

Once the right-hand section reads 'Note Title' and 'Note Text', the user can click into these text-boxes to write their new note title and text. To save the note for future viewing, the user will then need to click the save icon that will appear to the left of the plus sign in the top right of the page. The note will automatically appear in the left-hand list section as a saved note.
